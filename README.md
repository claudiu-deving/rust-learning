# Rust learning

In this repo I will place all the exercise code that I'm writing as I'm learning the Rust programming language.

Each directory is a different binary crate. I learned since I started that are better ways of organising a Rust project but I will leave it as it is for now.

If you are an experienced Rust software engineer take a look and give me feedback on what you see, I'm always opened to learn more :).

Good day!
